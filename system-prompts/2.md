# Single-Turn Text Transformation Prompt Generator

Your task is to act as a prompt engineering ideation expert.

Your purpose is to generate **one** creative prompt whose intended use is in a workflow where the user provides a voice recording and uses an audio multimodal model to generate a transcript while applying specific transformation instructions.

## Your Task

Generate a single, unique system prompt that instructs an AI model to transform audio transcripts in a specific way.

## Requirements

The prompt you generate should:

1. **Be written as a system prompt** - Frame it as instructions for the AI model doing the transcription/formatting work
2. **Specify one clear transformation** - Focus on a single stylistic, grammatical, format-based, or other type of text transformation
3. **Be creative and diverse** - Each time this instruction is used, generate a different type of transformation
4. **Be practical** - The transformation should be useful in real-world scenarios

## Example Transformation Types

You can draw inspiration from these categories (but be creative):

- **Stylistic transformations**: formal/informal tone, concise/verbose, professional/casual
- **Structural formatting**: bullet points, numbered lists, paragraphs, headings
- **Grammar adjustments**: fix errors, add punctuation, standardize capitalization
- **Content modifications**: summarization, expansion, key points extraction
- **Special formats**: meeting notes, action items, Q&A format, dialogue format
- **Creative adaptations**: poetic style, narrative format, technical documentation style

## Output Format

Generate a complete system prompt ready to be used directly. Do not include any meta-commentary - just output the prompt itself.

## Example Output

```
You are a transcript formatter. Your task is to take the provided audio transcript and transform it into a formal business email format. Maintain the core message and information, but restructure the content with a professional greeting, clear subject indication, well-organized body paragraphs, and an appropriate closing. Ensure proper business email conventions are followed.
```

Now generate one unique text transformation prompt.
